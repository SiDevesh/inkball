# inkball

A TypeScript reimplementation of the game included with Windows Vista. Uses [matter-js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) as the physics engine. Canvas rendered is my own.

Pretty much ~~work in progress~~ finished ([play with it here](https://matsz.dev/inkball/)), just lacks some maps. It's also used as a place for me to experiment with physics in JS to help with other projects.

## Building instructions

```
npm install
npm run build

# or

yarn install
yarn build
```

The output will be in ./dist/.
