A TypeScript reimplementation of the game included with Windows Vista. Uses [matter-js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) as the physics engine. Canvas renderer is my own.

**Maps are autogenerated**, although the generator itself needs a rewrite. First 3 maps are easy, next 4 maps are slightly more diffucult and the last 3 maps are the most difficult.

## Building instructions

```
npm install
npm run build

# or

yarn install
yarn build
```

The output will be in ./dist/.
